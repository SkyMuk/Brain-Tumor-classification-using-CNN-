# Brain-Tumor-classification-using-CNN-
One of the most aggressive diseases that affects both children and adults is a brain tumor. 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors are brain tumors. About 11,700 people are given a brain tumor diagnosis each year. For those who have a cancerous brain or CNS tumor, the 5-year survival rate is roughly 34% for men and 36% for women. Benign, malignant, pituitary, and other types of brain tumors are all categorized. To extend patient lives, appropriate care, careful planning, and precise diagnostics must be used. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is the most effective method for finding brain tumors (MRI).Because of the complexity of brain tumors and their characteristics, a manual examination can be prone to error. Automated classification methods based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have consistently outperformed manual classification in terms of accuracy. So it would be beneficial for doctors all over the world to propose a system that performs detection and classification using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and TransferLearning (TL).
So in this notebook we did a simple brain tumor classification model with 99% train accuracy.
